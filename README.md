# ðŸ”¢ Counter Application
This is a simple counter application made using create-vite-app and javascript. This application is a simple demonstration of how React is able to handle making complex UI changes at multiple places at the same time. 

## âœ… Lessons 
-   Utilizing hooks, particularly useState(), for state management within an application.
-   Gaining insights into React's internal processes, including its transformation of .jsx into valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   Incorporating dynamic variable changes within static code snippets.

### ðŸš« Mistakes I made 
- It's crucial to ensure that when employing an onClick() handler within a button element, the reference of the function intended to be called is passed, rather than the function itself. Otherwise, it may lead to infinite re-renders, as the functions would be immediately invoked upon each render, instead of triggering only upon the button's actual click event.
